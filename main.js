With beauty and fashion being a great way to express ourselves, we all develop a unique, individual style that works well for us and shows the world who we are without speaking a word.Beauty in the realm of fashion can be described as characteristics or attributes that lead to harmony, balance, attraction, and well-being. Beauty, both physical and spiritual, are positive traits that are globally revered and strived for. For most people, beauty entails an overall healthy, balanced, fulfilled lifestyle that pleases our highly visual, aesthetic senses. The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of inner beauty, which includes psychological factors such as personality, intelligence, grace, politeness, charisma, integrity and elegance, and outer beauty, which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis. Beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder!";

Craft blog awards are great and all, but so many of my favorites get overlooked! Do you notice that?    Maybe there are just too many wonderful craft blogs out there to acknowledge them all. So I decided to give a shout out to some myself.I’m not playing favorites . . . I’m just bringing attention to those blogs you may or may not have heard of that have great ideas and stellar craft projects.";

    var p="Do it yourself (DIY) is the method of building, modifying, or repairing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals. Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping).[1] DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as marketplace motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and identity enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness).[2]The term do-it-yourself has been associated with consumers since at least 1912 primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities.[3] The phrase do it yourself had come into common usage (in standard English) by the 1950s,[4] in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking home improvement and various other small craft and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity.Subsequently, the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of Skill sets. DIY has been described as a self-made-culture a culture of designing, creating, customizing and repairing items or things without any special training. There can be practical motivations behind these actions such as saving money. DIY has grown to become a social concept with people sharing ideas, designs, techniques, methods and finished projects with one another either online or in person.";
